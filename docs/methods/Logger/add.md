# add([string $Name, string $Path = null])
This method is used to add a new Log file to the Logger. It takes two parameters, the first is the name of the log file and the second is the path to the log file. If the path is not provided, the log file will be created in the same directory as the phpLogger.php file.

```php
$Logger->add('example');
```
